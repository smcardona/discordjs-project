//* TYPED INTERACTION / MESSAGES ZONE
/*
 * I had to implement this in order to easily manage types from discordjs 14.16
 * It is a pain in the ass (sorry but its true), now i have to manually tell TS that the interaction must contain a group of properties.
 * This becomes a little bit more verbosed but its ok
 */

//* old way:
//export type Interaction<T extends {}[] = [{}]> = BaseInteraction & UnionToIntersection<T[number]>;
//export type Message<T extends {}[] = {}[]> = DiscordMessage & UnionToIntersection<T[number]>;
// ? This way it still has to be with Merge because Merge transforms the items to any 
// ? so the compiler ignores if its even compatible to Intersect. Kinda unsafe, but it saves some time typing lol

//* new way:
export type Interaction<T extends {} = {}> = Merge< T extends BaseInteraction ? T : BaseInteraction & T>;
export type Message<T extends {} = {}> = Merge<DiscordMessage & T>; // DiscordMessage = Message form djs

/*
 * Context types for interactions
 * I got no idea if InVoice or InDMs makes any sense. Can you even run commands for voice channels???
 * I had to do this cz somehow discordjs deduced that message.channel could be a VoiceChannel or stuff like that

/*
 * I found this on google, pretty extrange but useful
 * I stopped using this cz it makes look types very complex even if they arent.
 * So now im replasing this for normal manual joins &, it even takes less characters lol
 * I'll keep the code commented cz i really liked doing this, made me learn a lot about generics.
